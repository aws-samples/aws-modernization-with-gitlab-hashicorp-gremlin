In this workshop we will work with __GitLab__, __Hashicorp__ and __Gremlin__ to show how to detect single points of failure within a gitflow deployment. 

- **In the hands-on lab:**  We will leverage _GitLab's CI/CD Pipleline_ and _Hashicorp's Terraform Cloud_ to deploy _HashiCorp’s Vault_ in a single non HA configuration and use _Gremlin’s Chaos Engineering Platform_ to identify weakness in the while developing and prototyping. 

- In the final labs will rebuild our architecture base on our learning and redploy Vault cluster using our exiting piplelines. Once deploy we will repeat our _Gremlin_ attack on our updated HA Vault Cluster detail that we have  mitigated the weakness the that were exposed during the inital prototype release .s
