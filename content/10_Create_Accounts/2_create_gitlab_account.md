## Login to GitLab

If you are a exsiting user [Login in here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)

If you do not already have a GitLab account, we suggest you [register for a free 30 day trial](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/). The steps below walk through the trial signup complete with a group/collaboration space for your teammates to test drive GitLab.

{{% notice tip %}}
The trial grants [full GitLab features (`Gold`)](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/gitlab-com/feature-comparison/) for 30 day. After 30 days, any trials that do not have valid credit card information will automatically transition to the `Free` tier automatically.

{{% notice warning %}}
GitLab's SaaS (GitLab.com) is single instance; multiple tenent setup. Each tenet contains one or more [namespaces (groups, subgroups and user IDs)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#namespaces). Namespaces __MUST__ be unique. A `Gold` trial for a namespace is only valid once. If you attempt to reuse an old trial, you will be limited to the `free` tier. Either reuse that account to complete this lab or create a new one; totally up to you!
